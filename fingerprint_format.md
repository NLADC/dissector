# DDoS Fingerprint format

DDoS Fingerprints are JSON files that describe the characteristics of a DDoS attack. They are distilled from DDoS 
network captures using the [_dissector_](https://github.com/ddos-clearing-house/ddos_dissector) module of the DDoS Clearing House. The input to the dissector can be FLOW data
or PCAPS.

Fingerprints generated from PCAP data may contain more detailed characteristics than those generated from FLOW files,
but their overall structure is the same.

Each fingerprint contains summary statistics of the entire attack, such as average bits/s, duration, and number of packets.
Each fingerprint also contains an array of _attack vectors_ that each describe one of the vectors that make up this attack.
Fingerprints have at least one attack vector. Examples are DNS amplification, TCP SYN Flood, NTP amplification, etc.
Each attack vector describes the traffic that belongs to that vector and includes information like source IP addresses,
targeted ports, and IP protocol.

When a fingerprint is uploaded to [DDoS-DB](https://github.com/ddos-clearing-house/ddosdb) - the database that stores fingerprints and allows sharing them between members 
of an anti-DDoS coalition - some additional fields are added.

The following fields are defined for fingerprints generated from FLOW data. Additional fields may be added to each attack
vector when using a PCAP as input, such as DNS query name and NTP request type.
