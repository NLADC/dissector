This script installs all dependencies to build nfdump, and builds it.
The output will be located in the ./nfdump folder (the binaries can be found in ./nfdump/bin)

It can be run using bash (e.g. /bin/bash install.sh). 
If it is run as root (e.g. sudo /bin/bash install.sh), it will also install all dependencies.

It has been tested on Ubuntu Server 16.04 and CentOS 7.
